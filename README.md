--------------------------------------

#### An implementation of the Thomas Schelling's Segregation Model. 
This is a simulator based on the "Dynamic Models of Segregation" work by [Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling).

It was developed as an AngularJS application and runs completely on the client side.

A demo of the web app can be [accessed here](http://jonathanhepp.pythonanywhere.com/schelling).
